Section (3) - MAPPED DATA
-------------------------

The following sub-sections describes the list of items that were imported from the
ISE properties and sources and mapped into the current project:-

Section (3.1) - Target Device
-----------------------------

Default Part = xc7a100tcsg324-1
Family       = artix7
Package      = csg324
Speed Grade  = -1


Section (3.2) - Filesets
------------------------

FILESET_TYPE   = DesignSrcs
TOP            = SX
DESIGN_MODE    = RTL

FILE_TYPE = VHDL
LIBRARY   = xil_defaultlib


<constrs_1>
FILESET_TYPE   = Constrs

Note: During the import operation, any constraint file(s) that are found in the ISE project will be added to the current Vivado project.
      However, please note that none of these files will be automatically marked as a "Target Constraint File". To set a constraint file
      as target, select the file in the GUI "Sources" window, right-click on this file and then select "Set Target UCF". Alternatively,
      the target constraint file can be set using the "set_property target_constrs_file <filename> <fileset>" Tcl command.

File(s):-

FILE PATH = E:/Github_Projects/xilinxisevga/VGA_1024X768/SX.ucf
